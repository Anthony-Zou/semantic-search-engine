Building a RAG System: Reinforcing Technical Fundamentals

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation system from scratch to deepen my understanding of semantic search infrastructure, event-driven architectures, and containerized development workflows.

Technical Stack:

• FastAPI for API development
• MySQL for document storage and metadata
• Redis for vector embedding persistence
• Apache Kafka for asynchronous event processing
• SentenceTransformers for embedding generation
• Docker Compose for multi-container orchestration

Implementation:

• Designed a dual-storage architecture separating structured data from vector embeddings
• Built the complete RAG pipeline: document ingestion, text chunking, embedding generation, and semantic retrieval
• Implemented async document processing using Kafka message queues for improved scalability
• Containerized all services to maintain environment isolation and reproducibility
• Implemented cosine similarity search for semantic relevance ranking
• Added event-driven architecture for background processing and analytics

Key Takeaways: Building each component from the ground up provided valuable insight into how RAG systems operate at the infrastructure level. Integrating Kafka taught me the importance of decoupling services and handling high-throughput workloads asynchronously. Understanding these fundamentals—from vector embeddings to event streaming—helps me approach more complex AI implementations with a solid foundation.

Fundamentals first. Better foundations lead to better systems.
